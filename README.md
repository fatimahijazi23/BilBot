# ðŸ¤– BilBot - Lebanese Arabic Voice-Controlled Object Retrieval Robot

BilBot is an AI-powered autonomous robot designed to interpret Lebanese Arabic voice commands, identify requested objects in its environment, and move toward them. It integrates advanced technologies like GPT-4 (via OpenAI), Whisper, computer vision, inverse kinematics, and Telegram notifications to deliver a fully interactive experience.

## Features

- **Arabic Voice Recognition**: Captures and transcribes voice commands in Lebanese Arabic using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Arabic to English Translation**: Translates Lebanese Arabic into English using GPT-4.
- **Object Extraction & Synonym Detection**: Extracts the object name from speech and generates a dynamic list of synonyms via GPT-4.
- **Image Inspection via GPT-4 Vision**: Takes snapshots and asks GPT-4 if the object appears in the image.
- **Object Location Detection**: Determines relative position of objects (e.g. "left", "right", etc.) using GPT-4 Vision.
- **Autonomous Movement**: Uses mecanum wheels and sonar sensor to navigate toward the object.
- **Arabic Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts status messages and prompts to spoken Arabic using gTTS.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Sends messages and photos to a Telegram chat for real-time updates.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi with Linux
- Hiwonder Arm & Mecanum Wheel Chassis
- Sonar Sensor
- USB Microphone
- Camera (e.g., PiCamera or IP Cam stream)

### Software & Libraries

Install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas sounddevice scipy gTTS openai aiogram

###Ensure you also have:

mpg123 (for audio playback)

OpenAI API Key with access to GPT-4 and Whisper

Telegram Bot API Token

###Configuration
Set your API keys and credentials in the script:

```bash
API_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID = YOUR_CHAT_ID
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
### How It Works
Voice Input: Robot records your command in Lebanese Arabic.

Speech Processing:

Transcribes it to text (Whisper)

Translates to English (GPT-4)

Extracts the object name (GPT-4)

Confirms the object with the user

Image Capture & Object Detection:

Takes a photo

GPT-4 checks for object presence and position

Navigation:

If object is found, robot moves toward it

Notifies you via Telegram with snapshot

Loop:

Asks if you want to search for another object
